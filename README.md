# king-s-county-house-price-prediction
This project is about predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the "KC House Data" which contains information about the sales of houses in King County, Washington, USA between May 2014 and May 2015.

The dataset includes 21 columns and 21,613 observations.

The objective of this project is to explore the dataset, perform some data cleaning, and create a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on some of the variables in the dataset.

# Data Cleaning
Import data and check the shape of the dataset
Check for missing values
Check column types and describe which columns are numerical, or categorical
# Perform Univariate analysis:
Calculate mean, median, std dev, and quartiles of numerical data
Plot histogram for a few categorical variables
Check the distribution of numerical variables and comment on it
# Perform Bivariate analysis:
Plot pair plots
Perform a Chi-square analysis to check whether there is a relationship between some variables
Calculate Pearson correlation, and plot their heatmap
Drop any unnecessary columns
Split the dataset into train and test set
Scale the variables
Machine Learning Models
# Two machine learning algorithms were used to predict the house prices in this project:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree
The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

# Conclusion
In this project, we explored the "KC House Data" dataset and performed data cleaning and analysis. We also built two machine learning models to predict the house prices. The Decision Tree algorithm had better performance than the Linear Regression algorithm.
